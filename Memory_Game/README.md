A fun and interactive **Memory Card Matching Game** built using **Java**.
This simple console-based game challenges players to find all matching pairs of cards by remembering their positions.

## 🎮 Features

* 🧠 **Memory Challenge** – Match pairs of cards by remembering their locations.
* 💡 **Dynamic Gameplay** – Automatically adjusts the number of pairs based on user input.
* 🔄 **Live Board Display** – See which cards are revealed and which remain hidden.
* ✅ **Progress Tracker** – Displays how many pairs have been found.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. You’ll be prompted to **enter the number of cards** (should be an even number).
2. Cards are represented by **letters (A, B, C, ...)** and are randomly mirrored on the board.
3. You’ll choose **two indices** at a time to flip the cards.
4. If the cards match — they remain revealed.
5. Continue until you’ve found **all pairs**!
